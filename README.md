Vista Suites is a study in **minimalist luxury**. The project translates a static PDF brand identity into a living digital experience. It focuses on the intersection of high-end aesthetics (typography-driven) and immersive motion design.

## 🚀 Professional Stack
*   **Vanilla JS (ES6+)*: Raw power for custom interactions without the overhead of heavy frameworks.
*   **Modern CSS**: Utilizes Grid, Flexbox, and `clamp()` for responsive fluid typography.
*   **Motion Design**: 
    *   **Custom Cursor**: A dual-circle interactive system with delayed following.
    *   **Scroll Reveals**: Staggered entry animations and image mask slides.
    *   **Hero Parallax**: 3D depth effect on scroll.
*   **Performance First**:
    *   Custom preloader system to ensure assets are ready.
    *   Optimized layout for zero Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
    *   Responsive image strategy.
